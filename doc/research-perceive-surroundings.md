# Basic Research: Perception of the drones surroundings

One of the first work package was to find out how to enable the drone to perceive its surroundings.

## Basic considerations

As our drone shall flight without external control, it will require the ability to perceive its surroundings. 
Even if there are many different ways, we all agreed that the easiest way to achieve that would be to use 
some basic distance sensors on a micro-controller. We already have some experiences with arduino, raspberry 
and such in our team, and this working package was perfectly suitable for parallel work, so we started with
it as one of our first steps.
